# Sit-stand cycling project

## Author

Ross Wilkinson, Ph.D.

## Overview

This repository contains the data and processing files for the sit-stand project.

The **aim** of this project was to compare the  distribution of joint power, muscle-activity, and effective mechanical advantage (EMA) within the lower-limb during seated and standing cycling at a variety of power outputs and cadences.

## Data collection

* 3-D motion capture at 200 Hz.

* Radial and tangential force on the left and right crank at 100 Hz.

* Surface EMG of eight lower limb muscles at 2 kHz.

## Data analysis

* OpenSim
  * Inverse kinematics
  * Inverse dynamics
  * Muscle-tendon unit lengths
  * Point kinematics

* Model
  * Full-body model created by Rajagopal et al. (2016) and adapted by Lai et al. (2017).
